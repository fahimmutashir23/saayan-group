        To increase shrimp export from Bangladesh needs to develop the quality
        of the shrimp. Also need to collect healthy and disease-free larvae to
        increase the production. In addition, the concerned authority should
        ensure a flexible logistic support system so that farmer can minimize
        their cost. Shrimp export is one of the most promising industries in
        Bangladesh. So we should not ignore it in any way.
